  if any arrears are assigned = owed to DOR/CSE, user can ask for equitable adjustment. Money that is not assigned is owed to custodial parent.

  Who do you owe?
subquestion: |
  As you know, 
  
  * we **cannot** help you with back child support you owe ${other_parent.name.first}, 
  * but in some cases we **can** ask DOR to forgive money you owe DOR. 

  Look at the Child Support Enforcement System Financial Summary Report.
  
  [[FILE DBD_AccountSummary.png, 100%]](${ account_summary_orig.url_for() })

  Under **Total Arrears** Look at the amount next to "Assigned."
  
<<<<<<< HEAD:docassemble/DeadBrokeDads2/data/questions/dbd-05-other-considerations.yml
  Is the amount **more** than $0.00?

question: | 
  You may be able to ask DOR for an Equitable Adjustment

  DOR can adjust the amount of child support you owe **them** if you had a good reason for being unable to pay.
