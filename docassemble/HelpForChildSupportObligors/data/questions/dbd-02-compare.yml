question: |
  What does the Notice of Delinquent Child Support from DOR/CSE say?
subquestion: |
  These notices can be confusing. The notice should look something like this:
  
  [FILE DBD_NoticeTop.png, 100%]
  
  The amount under ${other_parent.name.first}'s name (3),  is supposed to be your regular child support payment.

  In the middle (4) is how often you are supposed to pay child support.

  The amount on the right (5) is the amount of back child support that DOR CSE says you owe. This amount also includes any interest and penalties DOR CSE is charging you.
  
  What does DOR/CSE say these are?
fields:
  - ":one: What is the date on the notice?": notice_date_delinquency

      Note on arrears amount. If you do owe back child support, this amount may be different from your calculation because it

  You need your Notice of Child Support Delinquency to use this website
subquestion: |
  You need to have the information on your Notice of Child Support Delinquency  
  to use this website.

  If you do not have the notice, someone at the 
  [Court Service Center](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/learn-about-court-service-centers#court-service-center-locations-) 
  may be able
  to help you get your past child support orders.

id: dbd 02 - have proof
question: |
  Do you have any proof?
subquestion: |
  Can you show DOR that you never fell behind and always paid all the child support you owed? You can use: 
  
  * bank statements,
  * paystubs,
  * court orders,
  * receipts, and 
  * W2s.
yesno: documentation
---
id: dbd 02 - more info needed
event: more_info_needed
question: |
  You need more information or documentation
subquestion: |
  1. Go to the Court, 
  2. Get copies of **all** court orders, and
  *Caroline question: **all child support orders, or all P & F court orders that obligor was a party in, or orders in all courts?***
  3. If applicableâ€”give **all** copies to DOR immediately. 
  
  DOR may recalculate the amount of back child support you owe based on the documentation you give them. 
  
  If you think there is something wrong with the Court order(s) itself, and not DOR, you may need to file something with the Court instead of talking to DOR.
