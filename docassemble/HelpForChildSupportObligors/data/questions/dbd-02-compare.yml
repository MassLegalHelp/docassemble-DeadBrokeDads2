question: |
  What does the Notice of Delinquent Child Support from DOR/CSE say?
subquestion: |
  These notices can be confusing. The notice should look something like this:
  
  [FILE DBD_NoticeTop.png, 100%]
  
  The amount under ${other_parent.name.first}'s name (3),  is supposed to be your regular child support payment.

  In the middle (4) is how often you are supposed to pay child support.

  The amount on the right (5) is the amount of back child support that DOR CSE says you owe. This amount also includes any interest and penalties DOR CSE is charging you.
  
  What does DOR/CSE say these are?

id: dbd 02 - have proof
question: |
  Do you have any proof?
subquestion: |
  Can you show DOR that you never fell behind and always paid all the child support you owed? You can use: 
  
  * bank statements,
  * paystubs,
  * court orders,
  * receipts, and 
  * W2s.
yesno: documentation

id: dbd 02 - more info needed
event: more_info_needed
question: |
  You need more information or documentation
subquestion: |
  1. Go to the Court, 
  2. Get copies of **all** court orders, and
  *Caroline question: **all child support orders, or all P & F court orders that obligor was a party in, or orders in all courts?***
  3. If applicableâ€”give **all** copies to DOR immediately. 
  
  DOR may recalculate the amount of back child support you owe based on the documentation you give them. 
  
  If you think there is something wrong with the Court order(s) itself, and not DOR, you may need to file something with the Court instead of talking to DOR.
