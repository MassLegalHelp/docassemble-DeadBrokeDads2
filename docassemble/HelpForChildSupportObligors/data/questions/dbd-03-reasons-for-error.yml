question: |
  Look at the printout you got from DOR
subquestion: |
  Look at the printout you got from DOR/CSE.
  
  Does this look right to you? 
  
  One of the most common reasons for people to fall behind in child support is that the order changed and either:	
  
  * You did not know the order changed,  or 
  * DOR/CSE did not know the order changed.

id: dbd 03 - possible causes
question: |
  Events that may have caused your child support problem
subquestion: |
  Your child support order could have changed and:
  
  * you did not know about it, or
  * DOR/CSE did not know about it.
  This could explain why the child support order you have and the information on the Notice of Delinquency do not match. 

  Or there may be other reasons.

  Did one of the children move
    in with you 
    in with ${ other_parent.name.first]' parent
    out on their own
    to live with someone who got a custody order
  Something else caused my child support problem
