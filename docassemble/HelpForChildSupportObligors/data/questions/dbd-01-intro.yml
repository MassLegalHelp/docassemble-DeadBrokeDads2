field: welcome
question: | 
  Welcome!
subquestion: |
  We can help you fill out the forms you need if the Department of Revenue Child Support Enforcement (DOR/CSE) has done any of the following:  
  
  * Sent you a notice that says that you are behind in child support payments. That notice is called a [Notice of Child Support Delinquency](${ notice_of_arrears_img.url_for() }). 
  * Took your tax refund.
  * Started taking money out of your pay or is taking more money out of your pay than they should.  
  * Told you or your employer the amount of child support you need to pay is going up by 25%.
  * Froze your bank account so you cannot use the money in your bank.
  * Took money out of your bank account.
  * Took your driver's license or suspended your car registration.
  * Took your business license, your trade license or your professional license.
  
  Or if you have another problem with DOR/CSE related to child support.

  **We cannot help you change the amount of child support you owe your child’s other parent**. 
  
  If you need to change the amount of the child support order, you will need to go to court. See MassLegalHelp's [article on Changing a Child Support Order](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/children-and-families/child-support-changing-it) for more information.
  
  We can only help you with one child support order at a time. 
  
  If you owe back child support to more than one parent, you will need to start over with a new interview for each parent.

     In some cases, one parent or DOR/CSE asks the court to change a child support order, but the other parent or DOR/CSE does not know the order has changed. You need to make sure:
     
     * You are up to date with the most recent order, and 
     * DOR/CSE also has the most recent order, so they can calculate child support that is owed, correctly.
