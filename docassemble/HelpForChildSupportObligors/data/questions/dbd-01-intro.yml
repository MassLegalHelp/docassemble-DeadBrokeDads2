  **We cannot help you change the amount of child support you owe your child’s other parent**. 
  
  If you need to change the amount of the child support order, you will need to go to court. See MassLegalHelp's [article on Changing a Child Support Order](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/children-and-families/child-support-changing-it) for more information.
  
  We can only help you with one child support order at a time. 
  
  If you owe back child support to more than one parent, you will need to start over with a new interview for each parent.

     In some cases, one parent or DOR/CSE asks the court to change a child support order, but the other parent or DOR/CSE does not know the order has changed. You need to make sure:
     
     * You are up to date with the most recent order, and 
     * DOR/CSE also has the most recent order, so they can calculate child support that is owed, correctly.
